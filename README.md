# Connect-Four-Game-with-AI
Python code that lets you play Connect Four with an AI or play manually amongst friends (in person).

To begin, allow all four python files to run. You can then choose to go first or second by calling the function connect_four().
The function takes in two parameters: Player X and Player O. To play the AI, you can assign it Player X or O, but for 
sake of an example, let the AI be Player O and it plays on level 5 (the max). 

The function call would be connect_four(Player('X'), AIPlayer('O', 'RANDOM', 5)).

If you prefer to play amongst your peers on the same computer, simply call the same function, but replace AIPlayer() with Player('O').


Have fun playing and may the odds be in your favor!
